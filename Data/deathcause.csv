Caveats:
"1. Totals and Percent of Total are disabled when data are grouped by a 113 or 130 Cause List because both aggregate and detailed"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
"2. Aggregate values for MCD 113 and 130 Groups may not be the sum of their member values because a death record could contain"
"more than one member of a larger aggregate. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#MCD"

"7. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Deaths with the underlying cause classified with O00-O99 are"
"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
"processing and review and therefore should not be considered final for statistical purposes. Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."
