"5. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"

"subject to further processing before these deaths records are considered final. Provisional deaths have not undergone full"
